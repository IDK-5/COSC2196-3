						<h3 class="center">Jacob Depares</h3>
						<p>
							The overall objective for my career is to move into senior level leadership roles such as
							chief technology officer.
							The ambition would be to guide a company working with extremely high end and sophisticated
							architecture. I could see
							myself in a small start-up laying the foundations for future success or taking a larger
							company and projecting them
							into the future.
						</p>

						<p>
							Currently I’m fortunate enough to be an IT manager looking after both Australia and New
							Zealand for a multi-national white goods company managing a small team. Over the next 3 –
							5yrs I want to focus on key areas of development to improve my skills intellectually and
							professionally for such a role. I’m currently working on my bachelors of IT to ensure I have
							a well-rounded understanding of the industry confirming I have the knowledge to achieve my
							goals. In addition, focusing on my business knowledge through training and development
							projects in my current position. I’m also pushing myself to build confidence presenting and
							articulating with large groups of people, this is a personal area of improvement which I
							continuously need to practice and review.
						</p>

						<p>
							In the medium term, beyond the personal improvement strategy outlined above I would be
							aiming to take on a position as IT director leading a larger team. This would be the next
							career steppingstone to reaching my macro goal. It would allow me to take on higher level
							projects, improve my management skills and gain a higher-level understanding of business
							operations, all of which are key skills to a successful chief technology officer.
						</p>

						<p>
							Overall, my strategy for improvement, development and progression is simply to identify my
							weaknesses and constantly improve on them. Whilst long term the exact goal may change
							however, constantly assessing and improving my personal intellectual, professional and
							business skills is something that I believe will drive my career and provide personal
							satisfaction.
						</p>

						<h3 class="center">Larissa Hennessey</h3>
						<p>
							Having reviewed the Burning Glass data and topic essays from Assignment 2, my career
							aspirations have shifted. Whereas previously my ideal job was to work as a Software
							Engineer, my focus had narrow towards the fields of bionics and robotics. At the present, I
							am working with a major telecommunications company in fault identification and resolution.
							This has assisted me in developing team communication strategies, operating uniformly
							regarding procedures and customer management, managing expectations and working to tight
							deadlines. Although it is not directly related to my career path, it has set a high standard
							for all future work. Following my graduation from this degree, I intend on taking on an
							entry level job in my field so that I have time to understand the important aspects and what
							further qualifications may assist me. Admittedly I currently only know a limited amount
							about the widescale industry but have every intention of rounding out my education as
							necessary.
						</p>

						<h3 class="center">James Walker</h3>
						<p>
							Moving forward into a career in Information technology, I aim to be a Software Engineer. My
							career goals have remained solid and unchanged throughout the entire study process and
							career transition. My main goal is to focus on my studies while moving into a suitable IT
							position which can enhance my development and knowledge of IT beyond software development.
							While still early, I am unsure of what this will be as I must possess the desired skills and
							knowledge sought after by an employer.
						</p>

						<p>Once earning a bachelor’s degree in software engineering, my focus will shift to a junior
							developer position within a company which holds values in line with mine. Although I will
							accept any offer of employment within software development that comes my way during this
							time, I will maintain focus on my ultimate career progression.</p>

						<p>In the medium term, 5-10 years after entering the workforce, I hope to have found my way in
							the IT industry by identifying my strengths and weakness and continue to build on that. I
							hope to be working within a team which strives to make a difference. A likely candidate to
							consider pursuing is software development in the medical industry.</p>

						<p>In the long term, 10-20 years into my career, I would have established solid foundations for
							myself to lead a team of developers and pursue a career as a Software development manager
							within a field I am passionate about and could take many forms.</p>

						<p>My ideal job is one that makes a positive impact on society. The development of software
							which is affordable; solves complex problems, has a simple Graphical user interface and
							excellent user experience, regardless of their financial status.</p>

						<p>I will achieve this through hard work, punctuality, communication and perseverance. Maintain
							my improvise, adapt and overcome attitude keep up to date with current technologies and
							build working relationships.</p>

						<h3 class="center">Comparison</h3>
						<p>
							Whilst there is a clear pattern in all the career plans, some extend further than others.
							Jacob and James have looked towards their end term career plan, this allows them to collect
							qualifications in specific sought-after skills. In conjunction to this, it also makes it
							easier to identify companies which are currently leading the industry development when
							applying for jobs. Both of their career plans are geared towards eventually undertaking
							management inclined roles. James’ has indicated a team based role whereas Jacob seems to be
							aiming towards a company management role, which clearly have drastically different risks,
							responsibilities and requirements. Larissa’s career plan is less structured which makes it
							harder to anticipate the qualifications required for future roles but means that the path
							can be altered should there be a dramatic shift in the industry or their interests within
							it. That having been said, unlike the other two members, she has not indicated an interest
							in management. This can mean that employers will be more lenient in regards to certain
							skills, should she have consistently proven her teamwork skills. While all paths are valid,
							there are clearly strengths and weaknesses within all of them.
