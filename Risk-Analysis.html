						<h3 class="center">Financial</h3>
						<p>
							There are two major business risks when navigating our project, both stemming from
							government and organizational support. whilst our project aims to provide logistical
							disaster relief and resource management capabilities to the nation for this to ever
							materialize both government bodies and major organizations need to come to the party and
							collaborate.
						</p>

						<p>
							As there will need to be intervention on logistical chains and consumer consumption this
							indeed necessitates government body involvement. This may very well be the biggest hurdle
							for our project and without would be almost impossible to implement. Therefore, as part of
							our risk mitigation strategy we will be looking to secure approval and funding from
							government once we have a working deliverable to present. Once approval has been granted the
							next process will be to seek collaboration backed by government entities from major
							suppliers such as Woolworths, Coles, Aldi and the likes. It is imperative the mission of the
							project is clearly understood and united on between all stakeholders to ensure the project
							can be implemented successfully. Overall the above will be the biggest business challenge
							and risk for the project, without the successful collaboration there is the potential for
							the project to never progress thus it will be at the forefront for focus to managing the
							projects risk.
						</p>

						<p>
							The next major business risk is the necessity to secure funding. Due to the nature and scale
							of the project funding from external parties such as government bodies will be critical to
							ensure its successful implementation. Development of a clear, strategical and realistic
							financial plan will be necessary to secure funding from said entities. Unfortunately, it is
							impossible to predict the exact cost and timeline for such a project however, within reason
							we must ensure the financial plan is as accurate and justifiable as possible whilst also
							allowing for unforeseen cost to both finance and time. The financial plan will be imperative
							to secure funding and ensure the project does come to life.
						</p>

						<p>
							The success of the project is largely pined on the groupâ€™s ability to manage the above risk.
							Corporation from government bodies and large organisations is overwhelmingly important to
							the successful implementation of the project. Once this is achieved it is vital to construct
							and secure a quality funding model to drive the project into materialisation and deployment.
						</p>
						<p>
							The team at IDK-5 acknowledges that the greatest risk to their company aside from financial
							is the security of their computers. As a result, the team has put together a multi-tiered
							approach to ensure it limits any sort of outsider intrusion or data loss.
						</p>

						<h3 class="center">Computer Security</h3>

						<p>
							All computers will be designed around the use of a RAID 6. This will ensure that every hard
							drive has a balance of fault tolerance and speed. This will prevent any lost data should
							there be an unexpected shut down or hard drive failure. In addition to this, each computer
							will have Norton Anti-Virus and its associated plug ins installed to fend off external
							forces. This plan in conjunction with the use of Citrix to create a virtual server with
							change tracking will help to hold everyone accountable for the use of company information,
							ensure a frequent changing of passwords, two step authentication procedures and allow
							oversight for team leaders.
						</p>

						<h3 class="center">Cloud Function</h3>
						<p>
							Given current global debate regarding the freedoms of E2E security and cloud use, the team
							at IDK-5 decided that it would be best to utilise another company right here on Australian
							soil. Having researched prior to our selection, Datcom came out on top. In addition to
							having two decades of experience, they also specialise in Google integration and Citrix.
							This will assist with further security control and program implementation.
						</p>

						<h3 class="center">Oversight</h3>
						<p>
							Whilst trust is important in every employee and employer relationship, there will be a
							strong and structured review schedule of all employee work and feedback to help identify any
							blockers in progress or potential holes in our security network.
