						<h3 class="center">Whats the Aim?</h3>

						<p>
							The overall aim for ComCare is to develop a sophisticated nation-wide disaster relief
							resource management and distribution tool for government bodies to utilise. Australia is no
							stranger to natural disasters, victim to fires, doubts. Floods, cyclones and much more.
							Australia is ranked ninth in the world for natural disasters costing Australia $37 Billion
							in the years of 2008 – 2018. <i>(Letts S 2018, parra. 1)</i>
						</p>
						<p>
							Often during these times, it leaves surrounding neighbourhoods struggling to get resources
							they desperately need due to two main factors. Firstly, the effect on logistical chains,
							whilst households in the directly affected areas will most probably be evacuated the
							surrounding neighbourhoods supply chains are detrimentally interrupted during these times
							due to the disaster at hand. Comcare aims to deliver a tool helping elevate this problem.
							Collaborating with major supermarket outlets to determine their current inventory levels of
							essential items and what the needs of the people in the area are. Utilising this information
							to help navigate supply chains ensuring these areas are top priority for the supplies they
							need.
						</p>
						<p>
							The second major element effecting critical supplies in these areas is the unfortunate
							implications of panic buying by some consumers. The direct impact off panic buying is some
							consumers hoarding essential items leaving nothing for others. This behaviour also has
							devastating effects on supply chains and charities such as foodbank. <i>(Ky J & Peek K 2020,
								parra. 2)</i> Supermarket chains like Coles, Woolworths, Aldi and so forth where forced
							to put
							limits on essential item purchasing to help mitigate this behaviour during the international
							COVID19 pandemic. <i>(The Guardian 2020)</i> Comcares secondary objective is when needed to
							aid in
							the fair distribution off goods in disaster struck areas to ensure all families can obtain
							the goods they require.
						</p>
						<p>
							Overall the aim is to develop a tool which will help disaster struck areas manage their
							resources when the time comes. With the priority being on ensuring essential supply to the
							areas in need, mitigating the effects on the families who have found themselves in this
							situation. Building a multi-dimensional tool to firstly increase the priority and navigate
							supply chain limitations to ensure the supermarkets have access to the stock they need. Then
							if needed having the ability to limit the distribution of goods in the areas diminishing the
							effects of panic buying.
						</p>
						<p>
							Whilst the software and data management development are extremely import to ComCare, it is
							also imperative goal to ensure we have both government and supermarket support for ComCare.
							For the system to work in the way we intend. Without their support we wouldn’t have the
							capacity to influence such management of logistics and consumer purchases. Secondly funding
							would become a prevalent issue long term to sustain the development of the idea. The group
							will aim to develop a presentable deliverable for review to relevant government bodies early
							in the project plan. This will enable the security of both support and funding for the
							project
						</p>
						<p>
							The secondary objective will be the development of the data management and retail store
							interface to mitigation low inventory levels for supermarkets in disaster struck areas. To
							achieve this, we will be required to build an inventory data management system where stock
							levels off essential items are communicated to a centralised database nationally from all
							major supermarkets. This will give the overarching bodies capacity when there is a disaster
							to determine what is needed then working with logistical and retail partners priorities
							delivery of goods to these areas.
						</p>
						<p>
							The final major objective will be the consumer experience interface. Unfortunately, in some
							instances we understand mitigation strategies can only go so far requiring further
							intervention. To ensure we reduce the effects of panic buying and allow essential items to
							be evenly distributed across all in the affected area there will need to be a system to
							limit the amount an individual and family can purchase based on their needs. This will
							require both a way for the consumer to know what is limited and them allocate.
