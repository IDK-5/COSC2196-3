					<h2>Roles</h2>
					<p class="center">
						The team at IDK-5 intentionally did not set out the roles for either project. The logic behind
						this is that people do not apply for jobs they do not feel comfortable and confident in,
						therefore why should a student project be any different? As such, tasks were instead assigned
						during a team meeting where strengths and weaknesses were discussed to ensure the team achieved
						maximum success. That having been said, there is a common trend in the tasks that were
						ultimately chosen by each team member and their dream job roles as discussed in their career
						plans.

						<h3 class="center">Jacob Depares</h3>
						<p>
							If a role were to be assigned to Jacob based upon the tasks he’d taken on, it would be that
							of the project manager. This role is designed to ensure that from planning to closure, the
							team meets all deadlines whilst maintaining the highest standard of work. In conjunction to
							this, Jacob would also be responsible of managing the expectations of all stake holding
							partners and vetting all additional programs used throughout the development and
							implementation of ComCare.
						</p>
						<h3 class="center">James Walker</h3>
						<p>
							The ComCare project is an elaboration of James Walker’s original Assignment One project.
							This in conjunction with his strength in website management means that it only makes sense
							for him to be the user interface architect. His responsibilities include the development of
							the website structure, timeframe management and quality control. In conjunction to this, he
							also must liaise with the remainder of the team regarding product testing and content
							creation.
						</p>


						<h3 class="center">Larissa Hennessey</h3>
						<p>
							Throughout the development of ComCare Larissa has taken on the role of a Project Team Lead
							or more informally, a Scrum master. This job is designed to co-ordinate the teams and track
							their sprint progression. In addition to this, Larissa is also responsible for documentation
							and testing of the program throughout its development as well as designing training measures
							to be delivered to the end user, so they understand it’s complete capabilities
