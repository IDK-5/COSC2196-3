						<h3 class="center">Assignment 2 Review</h3>
						<p class="">
							Following the grading of Assignment 2, it became clear to the IDK-5 team that our approach
							needed to change if we wanted to ensure continuing success. One of the biggest realisations
							this project bought was that our initial project idea regarding cyber security was not going
							to be viable for the detail required in Assignment 3 and 5. As such, we have made the
							following changes.
						</p>



						<h3 class="center">Project Idea</h3>
						<p>
							Whilst the IDK-5 team is incredibly proud of their work regarding browsing security, it will
							not continue. Instead our course has been redirected due to the current impact of the
							Coronavirus. Moving forward, the team will focus on creating a website to focus in aiding
							the general public in understanding the logistics, restrictions, supply and demand
							supermarkets are currently experiencing. Whilst this idea was born from the current crisis,
							it’s work will continue throughout events such as cyclone and bushfire season.
						</p>

						<h3 class="center">Schedule</h3>
						<p>
							Having pushed to complete our last assignment on time, the team has instead decided to take
							a more careful approach to ensure quality and control. As such a schedule was laid out
							during our first meeting of this assignment period with the intent for the group to review
							our overall progress bi-daily. This ensures that everything can be reviewed before the
							deadline and that any assistance can be offered before it’s too late.
						</p>



						<h3 class="center">Checklist</h3>
						<p>
							Having reviewed the marking for Assignment 2, the team identified several areas where marks
							were lost due to careless mistakes. As such, an extensive checklist has been arranged to
							include the smallest of details. This will ensure all links and pages are functional.
						</p>



						<h3 class="center">Rewrite</h3>
						<p>
							As previous assignment components did not receive full marks, the IDK-5 team has taken on
							board all feedback and will be rewriting them to include the required information to ensure
							it receives maximum marks. It is important to the team that it addresses all questions,
							concerns or criticism raised by both markers and the customer base.
