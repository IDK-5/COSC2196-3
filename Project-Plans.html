						<p>
							After A2 as a team we had decided to change lanes on our project idea. Ultimately, we
							concluded that a project to develop a sophisticated nation-wide disaster relief resource
							management and distribution tool for government bodies to utilise was the path we would like
							to explore. Coronavirus brought to our attention the effects panic buying can have not only
							on supermarkets, but supply chains nationally, the elderly and overall the general consumer.
							Generating a conversation on how not only in times such as pandemics but this project could
							also be off high value during Australia’s notorious natural disaster seasons. Australia is
							ranked ninth in the world for natural disasters costing Australia $37 Billion in the years
							of 2008 – 2018. (Letts S 2018, parra. 1) Human emotion during these times leads many
							individuals and families raiding supermarket shelfs for anything they can get their hands on
							to stock up out of fear. This Psychology has been ever present through disasters, pandemics,
							wars and so forth as far back as WW1 (Wikipedia, n.a) There is also a very clear correlation
							between the functional disturbance of business caused by natural disasters impacting
							surrounding areas quality of life. (Fujita M 2017, Ian Burke M & Wisetjindawata W, 2017,
							parra .1) The team decided to call our project ComCare.
						</p>
						<p>
							Overall there are two main areas of resource management we would like to improve during
							these times. The first of which is prioritised delivery of essential understocked goods into
							disaster struck immediate and surrounding areas. The first step of this process is
							determining the needs for people in these areas. We aim to develop a web interface and
							application where citizens can register their location and any specialised needs they have.
							This will generate a logistical framework for the demand in the area giving the system an
							outline to determine the essential requirements of all effected, minimising the overall
							impacts and aiding with their recovery.
						</p>
						<p>
							The next step in building a fundamentally sound understanding off the potential resource
							distribution available is to build of a communication layer from the major supermarkets in
							the area. Here we aim to capture inventory levels for essential goods in surrounding
							supermarkets. With both the user requirements and current stock on hand from supermarkets
							data this will generate an understating off what items will be in shortfall for these areas.
						</p>
						<p>
							The objective to capturing this data and determining the supply and demand for essential
							goods in the affected areas is to provide respective government bodies the metrics to
							intervene when necessary. The foremost objective would be for these bodies to take this
							information and work with logistical chains to help increase supply as priority for the
							currently understocked essential goods to the areas desperately in need of these products.
							Through this collaboration we hope to see a highly targeted plan and approach of action
							based on ComCares data to help provide for affected areas. Mitigation of the issue whilst
							always is the team’s number one priority we understand that this may not always be possible.
							The secondary area of functionality our project aims to deliver is the ability for consumer
							purchasing to be limited based on supply to deteriorate the effects of panic buying.
						</p>
						<p>
							The secondary functionality like the first would consist of multiple elements. Taking the
							supply and demand data, if there is a determination that indeed there is a significant
							undersupply of essential items and any kind of panic buying will severely impact the lives
							of others, we aim to build in a way for the purchasing off essential goods to be limited.
							This will ensure the goods are evenly distributed across the community and no one is left
							without especially the most vulnerable.
						</p>
						<p>
							The first step to this process is through the for mentioned web and application user
							interface a limitation per family is to be communicated. This will ensure that all
							individuals in the area have an understanding off their purchasing limitations based on the
							current availability of goods. The next step of the process is to build an interface at the
							checkout in a supermarket. The interface will allow the user to tap a card of some kind
							(Potentially using NFC through the phone application) communicating to the checkout system
							the individual’s current status on any items with limitations. Then building in
							functionality to reject purchases if they are over the allocation. The final step of the
							process is once the transaction is completed then to relay the information back to ComCares
							infrastructure, recalculating the users remaining purchases available.
						</p>
						<p>
							This process will give the system a way to elevate any kind of panic buying and build a real
							representation of user demand in these areas to then improve the prioritisation off inbound
							inventory. The ability to enforce said limitations ensures that all member of the public
							effected by disasters do not have the compounding pressure of competing with their
							neighbours to get the essential items they need. Furth more this also takes the unnecessary
							pressure of the supply chain, warehouses, retail staff and supermarkets from consumers
							overbuying goods they could not possible ever use.
						</p>
						<p>
							Overall the objective for the project is to build a well-rounded multi-dimensional tool for
							resource management in disaster struck areas. Providing firstly valuable analytics for
							mitigation to help improve supply for the areas most effected. Secondly providing the
							capacity if needed to step in and ensure the fair distribution of essential items to all in
							need elevating the cascading effects of panic buying both on the logistical systems and
							consumers quality of life.
						</p>
						<p>
							For the project to be successful we will need to establish a robust entity relationship
							throughout the system. Below we have pictured the current standing on this relationship.
							There were many considerations to be made here.
						</p>

						<div class="report-img">
							<img src="images\ERD-A3.png" alt="DBMS ERD">
							<h6><i>Figure 4. ERD for the ComCare Database Management System</i></h6>
						</div>

						<p>
							Firstly, that of the structure and definition of a Family, we had decided to cater for many
							scenarios in the structure allowing for one family to be spread across multiple addresses
							and multiple families to be living at the same address. This will take into consideration
							situations where individuals complete the shopping for others not at home, for example
							elderly parents and situations of shared accommodation where many families are living at the
							same address. The only limitation that will be enforced is that each individual can only be
							a part of one family structure. We will also be asking for a primary address to be populated
							in the family table, this will be simple to send any mail to if necessary.
						</p>
						<p>
							Also implement the capacity to assign a temporary nominee, this will be extremely usefully
							for age and disability care facilities. Whereby there may be a different individual who is
							doing the shopping for a user. In situations where someone is shopping on behalf of another
							person allowing the user to nominate another member of the public for a period of time will
							ensure no one is left out even if this person is not within their family structure.
						</p>
						<p>
							We have currently also designed the progressive home user interface for logging into the
							ComCare application where users can register their details, validate a family structure,
							assign a temporary nominee and track any limitations for essential goods in there
							surrounding areas.
						</p>

						<div class="report-img">
							<img src="images/comcareAppConcepts.png" alt="Comcare Mobile app concept">
							<h6><i>Figure 5. Possible design concepts.</i></h6>
						</div>

						<p>
							Another consideration is the double handling off data, as every barcode is unique using the
							UPC system we will use this information as the Product_ID. (Range Me 2020) We could have
							created our own unique item numbers for all essential goods however this would be
							unnecessary as this system is already in place. Another example of this is the store ID,
							however in this case we need to take the opposite stance, we could use the ABN of the store
							however if the store owner owned multiple stores under the same ABN this would cause issues,
							thus we will need to assign unique ID to each store within the system.
						</p>
						<p>
							Another discussion that took place was in respect to the checkout interface. Firstly, we
							needed to decide how the user would ID themselves to the system at a supermarket checkout.
							We concluded at a multi solution response, the user can either use NFC on the mobile device
							or they will be sent an NFC card as an alternative. As a backup, if the user loses their
							card and doesn’t have a phone with NFC capabilities, the user will be able to login to the
							ComCare website and print off a temporary QR code that can be scanned whilst their
							replacement card arrives.
						</p>

						<div class="report-img">
							<img src="images/comcareCardConcepts.png" alt="ComCare card concept">
							<h6><i>Figure 6. Design concepts of the Government issued ComCare card.</i></h6>
						</div>

						<p>
							Secondly there was a discussion about how the terminal would engage with the ComCare system
							at the checkout. The first option would be that every time an item is scanned it would send
							a request to the system checking if the item was restricted and the family’s current
							remaining purchases. However, we opted against this path instead the checkout will download
							the table of all current restricted essential goods and the families remaining allocation.
							As the items are scanned the table will be updated, blocking any transactions over the
							limitation, then sending the information back to the centralised databases once the
							transaction is complete. This will add a marginal increase in compute required at the local
							checkout terminal however will remove the huge amount of network traffic required with the
							alternative.
						</p>

						<div class="report-img">
							<img src="images/comcareUserFlow.png" alt="User flow chart">
							<h6><i>Figure 7. Application flow chart.</i></h6>
						</div>

						<p>
							Another consideration would be in the situation where two individuals from the same family
							scan their cards at once, we need to deal with this as this could be an easy way for users
							to take advantage of the system. To mitigate this issue there is an activity indication in
							the table, if the table is active in another cahier system both cashier systems will update
							their tables and any other active tables. Ensuring that collectively the limitation isn’t
							exceeded.
						</p>

						<p>
							At the checkout we intend to include an indicator system for the cashier, if there are no
							current restrictions on the store, which would be majority of the time, no scanning will be
							required of the pass. Alternatively, if there are current restrictions tags must be scanned
							before processing. This will again preserve network bandwidth and in majority of cases allow
							the checkout process to be undisturbed.
						</p>

						<p>
							Finally, ComCare also aim to have local backups of family ID and current purchases against
							restricted essential items stored locally at the supermarkets. Natural disasters can often
							leave effected areas communication systems down for quite some time. To ensure the safety of
							the system during these times this will ensure that there is no downtime whilst
							communications are down. The supermarket interface will switch to the local infrastructure
							during this time.
						</p>

						<p>
							Overall the group was limited due to our lack of programming experience however, we were
							able to construct a fundamentally sound skeleton model working through problems and feature
							sets of the project. producing a strong project and action plan to move forward assuming
							that we were able to secure funding this will allow the project to work with a development
							team and fulfil the desired goals of the project.

						</div>

						<p>
							The next major step will be to build off the skeleton model to finalise the proof of concept
							deliverable and present this information to the relevant government bodies to secure
							approval and funding for ComCare. Without support from said bodies much of this project will
							unfortunately be unrealistic to implement. The project will need their support and
							collaboration to help with both the implementation of mitigation and the enforcement of
							restrictions on low inventory count essential goods. Another element we will need to secure
							is sufficient funding to ensure the project is financially sustainable to bring us to full
							national deployment. This will allow the team to onboard programming and infrastructure
							developments to aid with the technical and logistical elements of the project.
						</p>

						<p>
							Once funding is secured, we would be able to progress through the development and testing
							stage with the onset of full delivery and national roll out. Throughout this process we will
							need to work through public testing to ensure the reliability and functionality of ComCare.
							Overall for this process we aim to have 5,000 public users test from all parts of Australia
							to ensure a diverse and widespread testing environment. The way we aim to secure these
							numbers is through collaboration with supermarkets funding a campaign where users who
							participate will received $20 of their next supermarket purchases. Aiming here to secure an
							agreement with the supermarkets for financial collaboration keeping the public testing below
							$100,000.
