					<h3 class="center">Natural disaster relief</h3>
					
					
					<p>
						One of the keys aims of this project is to ensure that in the event of a natural disaster, any urgent or specialty supplies required for the area are directed there as soon as possible. This will be enforced by acknowledging the region’s registered population, alterations to logistical chains and redistribution of goods where possible. This ensures that a community already suffering doesn’t have to compete for necessities such as food, clean water and baby formula. This in conjunction with restrictive measures will prevent panic buying.
					</p>
					
					<h3 class="center">Prevent panic buying</h3>
							<p>
								By capturing a large amount of data on any given community, ComCare will be able to establish a par level in regard to the demand of essential goods. Following this, local authorities will be able to enforce limitations where necessary to prevent panic buying which creates a low stock level. This ensures that everyone has the same opportunities to thrive and survive in disaster recovery scenarios.
							</p>
		

						<h3 class="center">Monitoring of supply and demand</h3>
							<p>
								In addition to disaster relief, the use of ComCare on a large scale would allow the supermarkets that participate the opportunity to monitor their supply and demand as a region as opposed to a singular franchise. This would help to identify trends, cut back on unnecessary bulk purchasing, strategize logistics more efficiently and even alter the distribution of job opportunities within these chains.
							</p>
						
						<h3 class="center">Phone, card and check out application</h3>
							<p>
								Finally, the widescale aim of ComCare is to take the three aforementioned goals and seamlessly integrate them within a single system. Customers would register a ComCare account which in turn would be connected to a card or phone application. These would be identified with a scan at the check out to register all goods against their family account. This is how all purchase data would be gathered, compiled and reviewed.
							</p>

						<h3 class="center">Limits</h3>
						<p>
							The biggest limit of the project is unless enforced by local, state or national government; there is no way to make every supermarket participate. The option to opt in will be put forward to all chains, franchises and the like with the promise that competitor data will not be shared. Redistribution will operate under a “like for like” basis, meaning that companies can only alter stock within their own company.
						</p>	
						<h3 class="center">Scope creep</h3>
						<p>
							In order to prevent scope creep, ComCare will not be engaging any sort of sale or trade discussion between companies. Those deals are to be discussed solely by the buyer or seller.
