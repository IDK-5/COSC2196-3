					<h3 class="center">Individual Reflections</h3>
					<h4>Jacob Depares:</h4>
					<p>
						Overall, the group had some challenges being limited to 4 members at the start of A3/5 then
						having another loss of headcount leaving us to a total of 3 members for the assignments. I was
						proud to see the group stay strong and come together reallocating work and ensuring we all
						helped each other to bring the assignment over the line with quality. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Something that went well was the team effort, feedback and constructive criticism put forward
						between Larissa, James and me. Also having an excel to update on progressive work ensured there
						was visibility put forward to maintain everyone was on task.  
					</p>
					<p>
						A surprising aspect to see was the level of detail and though process brought out by all members
						on each section. Something I have learned about the group is the wide range of skillsets we have
						between the three of us, enabling us to apply them to such a complex
						and large-scale idea. Something to improve on for next time would be file management, especially
						for a task like this we had quite a few revisions of work so a better way to manage this would
						be ideal. 
					</p>
					<h4>Larissa Hennessey:</h4>
					<p>
						If there’s anything that assignment three has taught me as a team member, it’s that people will
						always surprise you. Less than a week from the due date, our team lost another member, cutting
						us from our original six to just three. This was quite shocking given the circumstances, but I
						was incredibly impressed with how everyone rallied together to ensure the work redistribution
						was fair and quick.
					</p>
					<p>
						Having learned from our progress during assignment two, our team arranged to have twice weekly
						meetings to ensure that we kept each other on track. This worked well for those that attended
						and ensured that our team kept a higher standard of work as we weren’t rushing to meet deadlines
						at the last minute. In addition to this, a spread sheet was created to keep track of task
						allocation, percentage completed and that the group had collectively reviewed each component and
						deemed it satisfactory. This enforced group accountability and kept everyone checking in on each
						other.
					</p>
					<p>
						If there’s anything I could improve about our assignment; it would be that I would check in with
						missing team members sooner. Whilst I had spent the assignment period struggling with health
						issues myself, I do feel as though this problem could have been addressed a lot sooner had I
						kept a more vigilant eye on the situation.
					</p>
					<h4>James Walker:</h4>
					<p>
						During Assignment Three, there have been challenges to confront, allowing our team to solve a
						new set of problems. We worked well together to improvise, adapt and overcome them together. I
						regard this attitude as a vital quality. Not only can mitigate the negative impacts of possible
						scenarios, strengthen the bond within a team and increase the likelihood of success. It can save
						lives.
					</p>
					<p>
						Although during the final two weeks the success of our team relied heavily on our ability to
						band together, assess the situation and come up with a prompt solution, this happened, not
						without stress, but certainly without fuss. I was pleasantly surprised, mostly because of the
						distance between us and haven't worked together in an environment which allows us to get to know
						and understand one another
					</p>
					<p>
						I have learned during this assignment that accountability is essential, and it is the
						responsibility of every team member to ensure our deadlines met, not only to ensure the timely
						delivery of a project but ensure all team members are contributing equally and coping ok. It has
						also been a reminder that if something is not ok, say something before it adversely impacts
						everyone. Think 'we', not 'me'; there's no 'I' in team!
					</p>

					<h3 class="center">Collective Group Review</h3>
					<p>
						Collectively A3 has demonstrated the value of good teamwork however has also shown us the implications off poor teamwork. Unfortunately, the team was reduced from six to four team members in A2 then we reduced once again to three members towards the latter end of A3. Fortunately, however the remained team members were able to regroup and redelegate the work that was assigned to previous members putting our best foot forward ensuring the work was done on time to a high standard.
					</p>
					<p>
						A few things that went well, firstly the delegation of work and constant meetings throughout the project. Ensuring all were able to take accountability and responsibility for their assigned work was extremely important to the project’s success. Catching up on a regular basis also enabled all team mates to check up on one another and keep on task. The remaining three members where always communicating in the Teams chat checking in on one another to see if we can lend a hand to help bring the project to completion.
					</p>
					<p>
						Something that could have been improved was to take action on the fact we had a team member MIA earlier, whilst they were there for the first meeting communication was not apparent and next time we should have reached out a little sooner to ensure they are ok. This would have given more team for the remaining members to pick up the extra work accordingly.
					</p>
					<p>
						One thing that was surprising was all the remaining team members willingness to put their hand up and help, ensuring all where on task and able to deal with the workload. Not to mention re allocation of work once the 4th member had left the team to ensure that all the work was complete to a quality standard. It was great to see the group effort and commitment to the task and each other.
					</p>
					<p>
						Something we have learned is the importance of communication and accountability. Open communication alongside regular catchups drives the team and projects growth. Accountability for one’s work is also imperative, not only to ensure the project is completed in a timely and efficient manner but to also ensure the work is done to the individual and collective group standards of all involved
