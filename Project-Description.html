						<p>
							The team at IDK-5 plan to be at the forefront of crisis management. Our current project is
							designed to help the general public to understand their position as consumers during
							national turmoil. Whilst the pandemic of COVID-19 has bought the need for supermarket stock
							control to the forefront, it is far from the first disaster Australia has had which impacted
							logistics or product availability. Our teams long term goal is to prevent misinformation and
							create a clear guide on the current enforced purchasing regulations during each individual
							crisis. In addition to this, the project will also provide consumers with information of
							current seasonable product, product defect notices and product unavailability.
						</p>

						<h3 class="center">Motivation</h3>
						<p>
							Everyone in the team from IDK-5 team comes from different backgrounds, yet all were impacted
							by the panic buying associated with the current pandemic. It became difficult to source
							certain products, no matter which state you lived in. The restrictions also became almost
							impossible to follow as there was no clear overall rule regarding purchases. Realistically
							this project fits in with the only IT trend that remains constant: convenience. It is
							designed to make things simple and straightforward. This will save time for the busy father
							on the go, help the elderly grandmother to know exactly what the rules are and the single
							student to avoid spending their studying hours wandering from store to store looking for
							toilet paper. If showed to an employer, this project would identify the team’s ability to
							focus on a broader picture rather than simply the effects on the community in the moment. By
							identifying a problem which affects such a large consumer base, creating a resolution and
							liaising with multiple government branches; the team has identified that it is more than
							capable of handling the most complex of tasks.
						</p>

						<h3 class="center">Landscape</h3>
						<p>
							This project is based on a smaller scale technology utilised largely in restaurants to track
							inventory and sales, an example of this can be found in applications Kounta, Lavu and
							JumpStock. The difference is that this product will be government supported, cover a variety
							of large supermarket chains, keep customer’s up to date with purchasing restrictions and be
							functional nationwide.
