						<h3 class="center">Meeting structure </h3>
						<p>
							Companywide meetings will be held once a month to discuss any new
							initiatives, achievements, blockers and accomplishments. This will ensure that all employees
							have the same base understanding of the direction of the company. During these meetings,
							ComCare will be utilising the audience engagement application Slido. This will allow for a
							question and answer initiative whilst also helping to identify key concerns within the
							workforce. Due to the number of employees involved, each team would gather in their own
							meeting room and make a collective MS Teams call. Team meetings will be held of a morning
							three times a week to discuss progression towards collective goals, discuss blockers and
							their solutions. It gives the team leaders an opportunity to update their members on policy
							or process changes. In addition to this, it allows the leader to gauge team morale. A happy
							workforce is a productive one after all. These gatherings can be performed on site or via MS
							Teams depending upon the working situation of the team majority that day. One on ones will
							take place once every second week to discuss individual performance, concerns or
							accomplishments without an audience. These meetings can be held face to face or over MS
							Teams.
						</p>

						<h3 class="center">Progress oversight</h3>
						<p>
							During the development of ComCare, progress would be tracked by assigned team leaders who
							would compile a weekly report for the project lead and project manager to review. It is
							through this report that sprint progress and blockers can be addressed and tracked to ensure
							that the project is delivered in time and manpower is redistributed if absolutely necessary.
						</p>

						<h3 class="center">Excel spreadsheet</h3>
						<p>
							In response to the report, all functions of the ComCare service will be broken down into
							sprints in a spreadsheet and assigned a percentage dependent upon where they are in
							development. This will allow a convenient and easy to read review which can be sent to any
							external stakeholders such as government members or supermarkets which have agreed to
							partake.
						</p>

						<h3 class="center">Microsoft teams</h3>
						<p>
							Each team members situation is different and as such, they may work from home or the office
							as required. In response to this, ComCare will utilise MS Teams to ensure that all questions
							can be answered promptly. A team chat will also be created which will allow for
							brainstorming and quick solutions in the event a team leader cannot be contacted. This is
							also a convenient way for members to liaise with members from other teams when collaboration
							is necessary.
